# CraigslistCaseStudy

#introduction

- Craigslist is a website dedicated for the buying and selling of items online, usually between two parties of regular residents
- Its very minimalistic
- Easy to signup, and post an ad

Use cases
- buying
  - user will select region, category, and subcategory
  - front page will search for available products 
  - you click on an add and replh to the seller
- selling
  - make account
  - select area of product
  - make a post and post it to the website
- target audience is for millenial/baby boomers because its very easy to navigate either buying or selling products.

Overall Design
- The overall design is good form a functional perspective but its not satisfying to use
- its a colourless design and not pleasing to look at which is what would make me prefer to use facebook marketplace
- although lacking in design it makes up for it from the easy navigation between pages and products

UI
- the front page is organized, understanble, and readable to the average user. it contains the faq and help pages at the front for new users having trouble
- the website is consistent throughout with the design
- the website is responsive on every device but the hitbox of the links on phones could be bigger or more seperated from other things as someone with larger fingers could be more frustrated using it on mobile
- it lacks any style or colour, it has no signiture art style, or comprensive design
- it is efficient in its load time and is optimized well for general use

UX
- i personally had a good experience with the website with no issues but i know the lack of design and colour can bug some people
- i went through the whole procces of finding, buying, and posting ads and can say it was easy and quick, although i would like to contact the person directly through the site and not email so its easier to keep track of what im getting or selling
- the methods of user feedback are very helpful with a faq, personal safety tips, and even a page to avoid scams and fraud

Design
- the website is readable and organized but every other design aspect it just falls flat. no colour, no design no flatery for modern users
- its suited towards mellenials and boomers which the lack of design wont be an issue for
- i would like it to have more of a destiguishable brand and style to the website other than a lack of css; facebook, amazon, and other sites have colour and is more generally apealling to use, i would like to see craigslist do this also for a classifieds platform

Conclusion
- its very easy to use, optimized well, good layout format but no good colouring or design practices have been used to make it better than its competitor, that being said the overall UI/UX is created very well
- i would make the website more apealling to a younger audience to increase more traffick to my site by adding its own distiguishable design that someone could easily recognize and associate with being easy to use
