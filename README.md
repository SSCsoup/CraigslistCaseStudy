# CraigslistCaseStudy

#introduction

- Craigslist is a website dedicated for the buying and selling of items online, usually between two parties of regular residents
- Its very minimalistic
- Easy to signup, and post an ad

Use cases
- buying
  - user will select region, category, and subcategory
  - front page will search for available products 
  - you click on an add and replh to the seller
- selling
  - make account
  - select area of product
  - make a post and post it to the website
- target audience is for millenial/baby boomers because its very easy to navigate either buying or selling products.

Overall Design
- The overall design is good form a functional perspective but its not satisfying to use
- its a colourless design and not pleasing to look at which is what would make me prefer to use facebook marketplace
- although lacking in design it makes up for it from the easy navigation between pages and products

UI/UX
- the front page is organized, understanble, and readable to the average user. it contains the faq and help pages at the front for new users having trouble
- the website is consistent throughout with the design
- easily accesible for disabled people
